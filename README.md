## Welcome to My Github Page!

My name is Spencer Phillips, I am currently a Principal Financial Schedule Analyst at Raytheon Technologies in Goleta, CA. In 2017 I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a double major in Applied Statistics and Economics. 

Below are a collection of my data science projects that I had worked on throughout my time at UC Davis. All of the code is going to be in the R or the Python languages.
