## Welcome to My Github Page!

My name is Spencer Phillips, I am a Applied Statistics and Economics double major at the University of California, Davis who is going to graduate in June 2017.

Here is a collection of my data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time at UC Davis. All of the code is going to be in the R or the Python languages.
